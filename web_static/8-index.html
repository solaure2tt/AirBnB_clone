						This unique place has a style all its own. A very quiet homely house with a modern contemporary style. 25 mins to downtown Ottawa.

The antidote to hotel rooms and sterile Airbnb rentals. Aesthetic and comfort abound in the charming and well furnished unit. Spacious and drenched in natural light. Take a look around, weâ€™d love to host you.

                                        	Welcome to my country house!
We're located between the villages of Gabia Chica and Alhendin, a 15 minute car ride from Granda. The house is a family home with four bedrooms facing south and southwest with terraces and private pool for you to enjoy all day. At the rear there is a kitchen and barbecue for family gatherings. Naturally you can use the kitchen inside the house, the living room, the terraces. The pool is only for your use and that of my family
There's parking for your car here, too.
